# Customised-Spotify-Playlist
The project involves creating a simple web-application using React and Spotify API that allows user to create 'personalized playlists' from the vast Spotify library.

This provides user with the ability to search effortlessly for their desired playlists directly from Spotify's extensive collection and then generate custom playlists tailored to their preferences that they can easily save to their Spotify account.
